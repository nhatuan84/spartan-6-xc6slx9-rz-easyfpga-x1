# spartan-6 xc6slx9 rz-easyfpga-x1 Dev Board Information
Files and Information regarding the Spartan 6 based Dev Board from China.
Some of these files were created with a slightly different board in mind,
so if something doesn't work, please verify, that pin definitions etc. are correct!

I have created a pin definitions file under "documentation". All information in that file is taken from the schematic.
It's not completed yet.
