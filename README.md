# spartan-6 xc6slx9 rz-easyfpga-x1 Dev Board Information
Files and Information regarding the Spartan 6 based Dev Board from China.
Some of these files were created with a slightly different board in mind,
so if something doesn't work, please verify, that pin definitions etc. are correct!

I have created a pin definitions file under "documentation". All information in that file is taken from the schematic.
It's not completed yet.

As a general info: you can use the Xilinx ISE WebPack Edition for free to program this FPGA: https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/ise-design-suite/ise-webpack.html

You can in fact install and run it on Windows 10 by following this guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMEIPCjqinA

Make sure that you download the correct file from Xilinx (not the Virtual machine version).
